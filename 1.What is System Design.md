📌 **Introduction**
-------------------

*   Systems aren't built in isolation—they evolve to meet real-world needs.
    
*   Example used: **opening and scaling a pizza restaurant**, analogous to designing software systems.
    

🍕 **1\. Starting Small: Vertical Scaling**
-------------------------------------------

*   **Initial setup**: One chef (single resource).
    
*   Problem: As demand increases, one chef can’t handle all orders.
    
*   **Solution**: Ask the chef to work harder, or optimize current processes.
    
*   **Technical equivalent**:➤ _Vertical Scaling_ – Improving a single machine (more RAM, CPU).
    

**Optimization Tips:**

*   Pre-make pizza bases during non-peak hours.
    
*   Avoid time-consuming tasks during peak load.
    

🔁 **2\. Making the System Resilient**
--------------------------------------

*   Problem: What if the chef is sick?
    
*   **Solution**: Hire a **backup chef**.
    
*   **Technical equivalent**:➤ _Avoid Single Point of Failure_➤ _Master-Slave Architecture_ – Main + backup server
    

🧑‍🍳 **3\. Scaling Out: Horizontal Scaling**
---------------------------------------------

*   **Growth**: Hire more chefs for increased demand.
    
*   **Technical equivalent**:➤ _Horizontal Scaling_ – Add more machines/servers to share the load.
    

🎯 **4\. Efficient Task Distribution**
--------------------------------------

*   Chefs with specialties: Pizza (Chefs 1 & 3), Garlic Bread (Chef 2).
    
*   Random routing is inefficient.
    
*   **Solution**: Assign tasks based on specialization.
    
*   **Benefits**:
    
    *   Efficient resource usage
        
    *   Easier maintenance and updates
        

**Technical equivalent**:➤ _Microservices Architecture_ – Teams/services with well-defined responsibilities.

🏬 **5\. Fault Tolerance with Distributed Systems**
---------------------------------------------------

*   **Problem**: Power cut or loss of license shuts entire shop.
    
*   **Solution**: Open a second shop (different location).
    
*   **Challenges**: Routing requests between shops.
    
*   **Technical equivalent**:➤ _Distributed Systems_➤ Handle requests based on geography/availability.
    

⚖️ **6\. Smart Request Routing: Load Balancing**
------------------------------------------------

*   Customer doesn’t decide which shop to use.
    
*   **Solution**: Central authority decides based on:
    
    *   Wait time
        
    *   Prep time
        
    *   Delivery time
        
*   **Technical term**:➤ _Load Balancer_ – Routes requests efficiently
    

🧩 **7\. Decoupling Responsibilities**
--------------------------------------

*   Delivery agents don't care if it’s pizza or burgers.
    
*   Pizza shop doesn’t care who delivers.
    
*   **Technical equivalent**:➤ _Decoupling_ – Separate different parts of the system for flexibility.
    

📊 **8\. Observability & Monitoring**
-------------------------------------

*   Log events like:
    
    *   Pizza oven failure
        
    *   Delivery delays
        
*   Analyze logs for patterns and insights.
    
*   **Technical term**:➤ _Metrics & Logging_ – For debugging, monitoring, and system health.
    

🔧 **9\. Extensibility**
------------------------

*   Don’t rewrite code for every new item (e.g., burger instead of pizza).
    
*   **Goal**: Make components reusable and flexible.
    
*   **Example**: Amazon went from parcels to groceries using same core systems.
    
*   **Technical principle**:➤ _Extensible System Design_
    

🧠 **10\. HLD vs LLD**
----------------------

*   **High-Level Design (HLD)**:
    
    *   How components interact (load balancer, services, databases, etc.)
        
    *   Scalability, resilience, communication
        
*   **Low-Level Design (LLD)**:
    
    *   Classes, functions, data models
        
    *   Efficient, clean code
